tf (as alias of terraform)

tf show (show plan)

tf graph (DAG visulazation)

when deploy new user-data.sh , need to restart webserver

when use module, the user-data.sh can not live in module dir?
	- in module/main.tf
	- template = file("${path.module}/user-data.sh")



// simple testing
tf console
> format("%.1s", "abc.t1")

count and for_each Have Limitations (only used in 'static' attributes)
	You cannot reference any resource outputs in count or for_each.
	You cannot use count or for_each within a module configuration

Zero-Downtime Deployment Has Limitations
	it doesnâ€™t work with auto scaling policies. Or, to be more accurate, it resets your ASG size back to its min_size after each deployment, which can be a problem if you had used auto scaling policies to increase the number of running servers.

Valid Plans Can Fail
	The key realization is that terraform plan looks only at resources in its Terraform state file. -> resources created outside of terraform, will have
	conflict.

refactor (rename resource)
	rename in the 'main.tf'

	terraform state mv module.webserver_cluster.aws_security_group.instance module.webserver_cluster.aws_security_group.instance222

	make sure "terraform plan" have no changes

Release modules
	$ git tag -a "v0.0.5" -m "message"
	$ git push --follow-tags

	When use github, need to have "//" in the source 
	source = "github.com/tuGithub/tf-test//modules/services/webserver-cluster?ref=v0.0.2"
